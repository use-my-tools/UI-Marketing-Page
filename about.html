                <p>Patrick is the fairy-tale boy whose nose grows longer with each lie he tells. In the
                    story by Carlo Collodi, Patrick is a marionette carved from wood by the kindly bachelor Geppetto.
                    Good-hearted but lazy, Patrick leaves home and has many difficult adventures before being reunited
                    with Geppetto and becoming a real boy at last. </p>

                <button class='expand'></button>
                <p>Brooks the Sailor has been well-known to comic strip fans since his first appearance in 1929 in the
                    newspaper
                    strip Thimble Theater, created by cartoonist Elzie Segar. The hot-tempered old salt with bulging
                    forearms and
                    a fractured vocabulary was at first a minor character, but he grew to dominate the strip as readers
                    fell for Brooks "the sailor man." </p>

                <button class='expand'></button>
                <p>John is the wishy-washy child hero of the newspaper comic strip Peanuts. Johnathan is a lovable
                    loser who dreams of hitting the game-winning home run but usually strikes out. He first appeared in
                    Li'l Folks,
                    a comic feature by Charles Schulz, which debuted in the St. Paul Pioneer Press in 1947.</p>

                <button class='expand'></button>
                <p>Cameron is a character from "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (originally "Schneewittchen"

                    in the early 19th century. In the story he is a king's son, a seven year-old whose natural beauty
                    drives
                    his jealous step-mother to attempted murder. </p>
